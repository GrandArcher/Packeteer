# Threat model

Packeteer can change how a network forwards packets. Failure modes matter more than features.

## Routing failures

- **Flap** — oscillating improvements. Mitigate with hold time, hysteresis, and a max flip rate.
- **Leak** — more-specifics learned from Packeteer advertised to transit. Mitigate with a well-known community and outbound filters on every eBGP session.
- **Blackhole** — inject toward a next-hop that is down. Mitigate by requiring a live RIB path and withdrawing on probe-source or session failure.
- **Over-injection** — thousands of more-specifics exhaust TCAM. Mitigate with max-improvements and prefix aggregation policy.
- **Stale intent** — controller dies, routes remain. Packeteer withdraws on shutdown and never enables graceful restart; the BGP hold timer is the backstop if the process is killed before the withdraw is sent.

## Measurement failures

- Asymmetric return path on probes
- Provider rate-limiting ICMP
- Probing the wrong source address (not actually leaving via that transit)

## Operational / public-repo failures

- Secrets or customer prefixes committed here
- CI publishing production telemetry
- An agent enabling `inject` in example config

Example config must remain `mode: observe`.
